**Data**

Our group project will explore if the Transit Oriented Development vision, which includes the implementation of a BRT and rail system in the Gauteng region (Johannesburg) has changed attitudes towards race. To do this we will need two main data sources.

First, the GCRO's quality of life survey which is a biennial survey, measuring the quality of life, socio-economic circumstances, attitudes to service delivery, psycho-social attitudes, value-base and other characteristics of the Gauteng City Region. It serves as a tracking and diagnostic tool, affording a rich information resource for policymakers and the public wanting to see where progress is being made, and where concerns remain. It collects data on perceptions towards foreigners and other races. Given that this survey has been conducted since 2009, we are able to see how attitudes have changed over time. 

Second, we will need shapefiles of the wards, in order to see what the spatial distribution of attitudes towards foreigners and other races is. 

The data was downloaded from data first, a data repository managed by the University of Cape Town: https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/GCRO/about 

The files are available in the data 2 folder.
