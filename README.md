# About Me

Hi there! I'm Yasmina Yusuf and I am a second year MURP. I am half German - half Bangladeshi but grew up in the UK. I have spent the last 6 years working in international development, first as an international development consultant mainly on economic development projects for UKAID and more recently based in Sierra Leone (West Africa) working on accessibility issues for informal settlements. 

# Course Description

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

# Project Ideas

I haven't developed in depth project ideas, however I am eager to work on accessibility to public transportation for disadvantaged population groups, such as those living in informal settlements (although that data might be hard to find, as collecting data on informality is challenging). I am also open to other projects that are focussed on cities in the Global South. 

# Course objectives 

I hope to gain basic knoweldge about Python and GIS taht I can apply to my work, for example on project reports. I also hope that this course enables me to engage more with the GIS world, collaborate wih GIS experts and also be more critcal of spatial data analysis.
